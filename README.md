# Remote Syslog Logger

This library providers an [ActiveSupport][] compatible logger that logs 
directly to a remote syslogd via UDP.

[ActiveSupport]: http://as.rubyonrails.org/


# Installation

The easiest way to install `remote_syslog_logger` is with Bundler. Add
`remote_syslog_logger` to your `Gemfile`.

If you are not using a `Gemfile`, run:

    $ [sudo] gem install remote_syslog_logger


# Usage

Use from Rails:

    config.logger = RemoteSyslogLogger.new('syslog.domain.com', 514, :program => "rails-#{RAILS_ENV}")
    config.logger.level = Logger::INFO # ... or Logger::DEBUG (if development)

Use from Ruby:

    $logger = RemoteSyslogLogger.new('syslog.domain.com', 514)

To point the logs to your local system, use `localhost` and ensure that
the system's syslog daemon is bound to `127.0.0.1`.


# Source

Remote Syslog Logger is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:

<http://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog_logger>

and cloned with:

    $ git clone git://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog_logger.git


# Limitations

If the specified host cannot be resolved, `syslog.domain.com` in the
example under the usage section above, `remote_syslog_logger` will block
for approximately 20 seconds before displaying an error.  This could
result in the application failing to start or even stopping responding.

Workarounds for this include:

* use an IP address instead of a hostname.
* put a hosts entry in `/etc/hosts` or equivalent, so that DNS is not
actually consulted
* instead of logging directly to the network, write to a file and
transmit new entries with a standalone daemon like
[remote_syslog](https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog),
